- i like you, i like spending time with you
- i think that we should definitely try
- i know that it stresses you out, but we can make it work
- the setup right now is terrible and there is are better ways to do this
  - we need to organise things better
  - for example, we can see each other less often so that the time we spend together is not stressed
- you need to know i am telling you this because i know it stresses you out, i would be happy as well not to hide it but given that it stresses you out, I am also happy to do it like that and maybe with time you won't mind sharing at anymore
- i know that 	for the moment it appears that i am not good at taking descision adn knowing what i want but in this case i actually do
